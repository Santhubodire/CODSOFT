CODSOFT Internship Projects
Welcome to the CODSOFT internship repository! This repository contains the Java-based projects I completed during my internship at CODSOFT. The projects helped me strengthen my programming skills, problem-solving abilities, and understanding of real-world software development.

Projects Overview
1.Number Game
A fun, interactive number guessing game where users try to guess a randomly generated number. This project improved my skills in random number generation, loops, and user input handling in Java.

2.Student Grade Calculator
A tool that calculates students' grades based on input marks. It utilizes conditional statements and loops to evaluate and display grades, helping me understand data handling and business logic in Java.

3.ATM Interface
A simulated ATM system that allows users to check balances, withdraw, and deposit money. It includes user authentication and transaction management, teaching me about security and file handling in Java.

4.Quiz Application with Timer
A quiz app where users answer questions under a time limit. The app uses event-driven programming and a countdown timer, which enhanced my knowledge of real-time user interactions and managing timers in Java.

5.Student Course Registration System
A system allowing students to register for courses, view available classes, and manage their schedules. This project improved my understanding of database management, error handling, and building scalable applications.

Technologies Used
Java

How to Run the Projects
Clone this repository to your local machine using the command:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CODSOFT.git
Navigate to each project folder and open the Java files using any IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
Compile and run the Java files to test the functionality.

Conclusion
These projects were a great way to learn and apply my Java skills in real-world scenarios. I'm excited to continue developing my skills and working on more projects in the future. Feel free to explore the code and reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!
